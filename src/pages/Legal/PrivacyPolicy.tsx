                repair services, budgeting services and rental services)
                includes my application information held by the Lender, my
                identification details, what type of loans I have, how much I
                have borrowed, whether or not I have met my loan payment
                obligations and if I have committed a serious credit
                infringement (for example, fraud).

                credit providers and alternate service providers who may use my
                customer data for any of the purposes for which the Lender can
                use it. I can request that this authority be withdrawn at any
                time.

                including a funding partner or debt purchaser.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Lender may provide a notice of assignment to you in
                accordance with applicable laws and, unless a law requires
                otherwise, such notice may be provided electronically, including
                by email, using the contact details you have provided to the
                Lender.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purposes of effecting and administering an assignment,

              </ul>
              <p>
                The Lender may take reasonable steps to ensure that any third
                party to whom a loan or debt is assigned handles your personal
                information securely and in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988
                (Cth) and other applicable privacy laws.

              <p>
                By providing your contact details to the Lender, you consent to
                receiving notices of assignment and related communications
                electronically. You are responsible for ensuring that your
                contact information remains accurate and up to date.

                Lender using the details set out in this Privacy Policy.
